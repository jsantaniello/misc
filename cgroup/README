These scripts are to provide a Tornado specific interface to Linux cgroups.

The host system requires libcgroup1 and cgroups-bin, but make sure to disable any services such as cgroup-lite as we handle all that stuff ourselves.

Ideally the Tornado CP makes changes to (and creates) the files in the "groups" directory as it sees fit in order to specify resource allocation for a specific user.

The script "mkcgrp.sh" iterates over and .conf files it finds in the "groups" directory and creates cgroups for the controllers specified in that .conf file.

It then modifies the /etc/cgrules.conf file so cgrulesengd can shuffle new processes into the proper cgroup as they are created by for example apache.

Users who do not have a .conf file in the "groups" directory get assigned to a "catchall" group.

This in effect ensures that all users (apache suexec/suphp virtual hosts) get at least some resources should they need them. Users with .conf files can be configured so they have at all times a higher (or lower!) minimum resource garanty.

It is decreed that units 2, 4, 8, 16,etc be used for describing relative weights of cpu resource allocation. Memory units should be in the form 256M, 512M, etc. This is combined memory: swap + real.

All users get by deault (catchall) cpu.shares=2 and memory.limit_in_bytes=245M.

This means that if there are only 2 active users, and both are trying to use as much cpu as possible, both will be garanteed at least 50%. On multicore systems, they would each get 100% of their own core, but this holds true as the cores are used up, so to keep it simple we pretend with have a single core.

If we introduce a 3rd user, and give this user a cpu.shares=3, and all 3 of these users tyr for maximum cpu, user 3 who has 2x the shares, would get 50%, and the other 2 users would split the remaining 50% and get 25% each. If we add another shares=2 user, they have a combined share og 6, while the other user has 4, and thus that user would get 40% and the other 3 would split the remaining 60% or 20% each.

Memory limits are limits on the total memory that group can use.
